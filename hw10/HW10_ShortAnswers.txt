1. What is the fundamental difference between how Java and C++ implement collections?

In Java, collections of objects need to be converted to it corresponding wrapper class. In C++, collections are templates, which means that the compiler generates the code for a class exactly as you would like it to be.

2. What is the difference between a template and a class?

A template is a special function that can operate with generic data types and can be adapted to more than one type of class. Meanwhiles, a class needs its data type specified to be created.

3. What are some of the drawbacks of templates?

The compiler creates and compiles a new version of the class every time the template is instantiated, making executable files larger and compilation times slower. Also, different classes utilizing templates are unrelated and canâ€™t be cast to each other.

4. What is an iterator?

An iterator is a class that represents the current element of a collection and allows for stepping from one element to the next.
